The Chicago Botanic Garden Plants of Concern (POC) program has monitored about 300 endangered, threatened, and rare species at over 300 sites throughout the US Central Wilderness region.
Maintains a centralized database of rare plant information.
Analyses of POC’s datasets yield critical information on rare species’ population trends in relation to management activities on a region-wide basis.
POC has worked with over 100 public and private landowners. For their participation, these landowners receive critical data that helps them set goals and evaluate land management practices.
